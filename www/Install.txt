== Install Guide ==

Please remember to backup your database regularly.

1. Upload these files to your webserver.
2. Edit "./settings/config.php"
3. Make a backup of your database ;)
4. Import the .sql files inside "./www/sql_update/" into your MySql database (I placed mine in the opensim database)
5. copy the ./AuroraService/WiReduxHandler.cs to your ~/aurora-sim-Aurora-Sim/OpenSim/Server/Handlers/AuroraService/ directory
6. Run runprebuild.bat or runprebuild2010.bat
7. Run compile.bat
8. Edit your approprate config file and add the following under [Handlers]. For example: ~/aurora-sim-Aurora-Sim/bin/Configuration/Standalone/Standalone.ini

	WireduxHandler = WireduxHandler
	WireduxHandlerPort = 8007
	WireduxHandlerPassword = ***
	
* note, I don't know if that is the best place for them.. but it works.. 

If you install a new version over your old one, remember to run "Update DB" from the admin menu, 
it will update the webinterface users table.

The admin menu is located at:
http://yourdomain.com/admin

Default admin username and password are:

Username: admin
Password: admin

Enjoy Aurora WiRedux

== Trouble Shooting ==

-----* Page editor will not load in Administrator Section.

    While testing on osgrid.org we resolved this issue by creating a .htaccess file in the root of your website with the following code

    [code]
        RewriteEngine On  
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yourdomain.com$  
        RewriteRule (.*)$ http://yourdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
    
    [/code]

-----* Set up your php.ini mail

-----* Says unknow error, or something when wrong right after I turned on opensim.. 

<skidz> oh.. one thing to note.. 
<skidz> opensim seems to have a bug.. when making calls to the handler.. the first one always fails after you start opensim
<skidz> It actually runs.. but.. the data is never returned to the php.. 
<skidz> but.. after that first.. seems to work fine.. 
<skidz> I have not tried to debug this yet
<skidz> I should add that in the install.. lol

-----* I get the following message trying to load opensimwi in my web browser:

[error]

query("SELECT password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE password='$_SESSION[ADMINUID]'"); list($admpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($admpass){ $ADMINCHECK = $admpass; }else{ $ADMINCHECK = "454"; } if($_POST[adminlogin]=="admincheck"){ $pass = $_POST[password]; $passcheck = md5(md5($pass) . ":" ); $DbLink->query("SELECT username,password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE username='$_POST[username]'"); list($adminname,$adminpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($adminpass == $passcheck){ $_SESSION[ADMINUID] = $adminpass; } } if($_POST[check]==1){ echo ""; } ?>

[/error]

Resolution:  Your PHP is not configured to use short tags or asp style, to fix the problem edit your php.ini and locate the following lines:

[find]

short_open_tag = Off

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = Off

[/find]

[change to]

short_open_tag = On

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = On

[/change to]

After you save your php.ini restart apache and you should be ok now.


-----* I get the following message trying to load opensimwi in my web browser:

[error]

Notice: Use of undefined constant ......

[/error]

Resolution:  Your PHP is not configured to handle errors properly

[find]

error_reporting = E_ALL 

[/find]

[change to]

error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

[/change to]
