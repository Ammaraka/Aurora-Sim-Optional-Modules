== Install Guide ==

Please remember to backup your database regularly.

1. Upload these files to your webserver.
2. Edit "./settings/config.php"
3. Make a backup of your database ;)
4. Import the .sql files inside "./www/sql_update/" into your MySql database (I placed mine in the opensim database)
5. copy the contents of the ./AuroraService/addon-modules/ directory into your ~/Aurora-Sim/addon-modules/ directory
6. Run runprebuild.bat or runprebuild2010.bat
7. Run compile.bat
8. In the Aurora-Sim\bin\AuroraServerConfiguration\Main.ini ensure the password matches the websites /settings/config.php

	WireduxHandler = WireduxHandler
	WireduxHandlerPort = 8007
	WireduxHandlerPassword = ***

In /aurora-sim-Aurora-Sim/bin/AuroraServerConfiguration/Main.ini  <==Grid Mode
Above WireduxHandlers are already there for Grid Mode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

== Admin Panel ==
The Admin Panel is located at:
http://yourdomain.com/admin

To add your user as an Admin Panel User:

Open your database with some form of editor and find the 'useraccounts' table.
Open the user accounts table and find the user that you wish to allow to use the Admin Panel
In the 'UserFlags' column, add '2048' to the number already there.

The user will now be able to use the Admin Panel as given above

Enjoy Aurora WiRedux

-----------------------------------------------------------------

== Choose avatar ==
To choose a avatar on registration you have to make some avatar archives

NOTE: I have only tested this with database archives and not file archives. 
To save a archive in the database you must give it a name ending with ".database"

Note: When displaying textures from the texture server they will be resized to 128x128 and at the bottom will be writen the grid nickname

1. Dress a avatar up like you want it to look
2. Take a picture of it and upload this to the grid
3. in the console of the grid server issue this command 
save avatar archive <First> <Last> <Filename> <FolderNameToSaveInto> [<SnapshotUUID>] [<Public>]
example:
save avatar archive Skidz Tweak EvilOverlord.database "" 00000-0000-0000-0000-00000 1

NOTE: Only pulic ones will be listed on the website

== Trouble Shooting ==

-----* Page editor will not load in Administrator Section.

    While testing on osgrid.org we resolved this issue by creating a .htaccess file in the root of your website with the following code

    [code]
        RewriteEngine On  
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yourdomain.com$  
        RewriteRule (.*)$ http://yourdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
    
    [/code]

-----* Set up your php.ini mail

-----* Says unknow error, or something when wrong right after I turned on opensim.. 

<skidz> oh.. one thing to note.. 
<skidz> opensim seems to have a bug.. when making calls to the handler.. the first one always fails after you start opensim
<skidz> It actually runs.. but.. the data is never returned to the php.. 
<skidz> but.. after that first.. seems to work fine.. 
<skidz> I have not tried to debug this yet
<skidz> I should add that in the install.. lol

-----* I get the following message trying to load opensimwi in my web browser:

[error]

query("SELECT password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE password='$_SESSION[ADMINUID]'"); list($admpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($admpass){ $ADMINCHECK = $admpass; }else{ $ADMINCHECK = "454"; } if($_POST[adminlogin]=="admincheck"){ $pass = $_POST[password]; $passcheck = md5(md5($pass) . ":" ); $DbLink->query("SELECT username,password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE username='$_POST[username]'"); list($adminname,$adminpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($adminpass == $passcheck){ $_SESSION[ADMINUID] = $adminpass; } } if($_POST[check]==1){ echo ""; } ?>

[/error]

Resolution:  Your PHP is not configured to use short tags or asp style, to fix the problem edit your php.ini and locate the following lines:

[find]

short_open_tag = Off

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = Off

[/find]

[change to]

short_open_tag = On

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = On

[/change to]

After you save your php.ini restart apache and you should be ok now.


-----* I get the following message trying to load opensimwi in my web browser:

[error]

Notice: Use of undefined constant ......

[/error]

Resolution:  Your PHP is not configured to handle errors properly

[find]

error_reporting = E_ALL 

[/find]

[change to]

error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

[/change to]
