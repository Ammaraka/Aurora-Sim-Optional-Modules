OpenSim WebInterface Redux v0.28

== Install Guide ==

Please remember to backup your database regularly.

1. Upload these files to your webserver.
2. Edit "./settings/config.php"
3. Make a backup of your database ;)
4. Import the .sql files inside "./sql_update/" into your MySql database

If you install a new version over your old one, remember to run "Update DB" from the admin menu, 
it will update the webinterface users table.

The admin menu is located at:
http://yourdomain.com/admin

Default admin username and password are:

Username: admin
Password: test 

Enjoy OpenSimWebInterface-Redux

== Notes about Upgrading your old opensimwi ==

You need to install the new tables wich comes with this version, 

You need also the new pagemanager table instead off sitemanager table

-----------------------------------------------------------------

== Trouble Shooting ==

-----* Page editor will not load in Administrator Section.

    While testing on osgrid.org we resolved this issue by creating a .htaccess file in the root of your website with the following code

    [code]
        RewriteEngine On  
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yourdomain.com$  
        RewriteRule (.*)$ http://yourdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
    
    [/code]



-----* I get the following message trying to load opensimwi in my web browser:

[error]

query("SELECT password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE password='$_SESSION[ADMINUID]'"); list($admpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($admpass){ $ADMINCHECK = $admpass; }else{ $ADMINCHECK = "454"; } if($_POST[adminlogin]=="admincheck"){ $pass = $_POST[password]; $passcheck = md5(md5($pass) . ":" ); $DbLink->query("SELECT username,password FROM ".C_ADMIN_TBL." WHERE username='$_POST[username]'"); list($adminname,$adminpass) = $DbLink->next_record(); if($adminpass == $passcheck){ $_SESSION[ADMINUID] = $adminpass; } } if($_POST[check]==1){ echo ""; } ?>

[/error]

Resolution:  Your PHP is not configured to use short tags or asp style, to fix the problem edit your php.ini and locate the following lines:

[find]

short_open_tag = Off

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = Off

[/find]

[change to]

short_open_tag = On

; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
asp_tags = On

[/change to]

After you save your php.ini restart apache and you should be ok now.
